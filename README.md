# recommender-systems
Report and corresponding Python code for an assignment on recommender systems for the course Advances in Data Mining 
at Leiden University. The project has been carried out together with Freek van Geffen. 

Three documents are included in this repository: 
1. The actual assignment
2. A written report
3. Python code

Results presented in report.pdf can be reproduced by running the Assignment1_VanGeffen_Kraaijenbrink.ipynb 
in Jupyter Notebook with random seed 2020. 

In order to get the notebook running, you should load the files: 
	- movings.dat
	- users.dat
	- ratings.dat

These datafiles can be obtained from http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. Besides, the correct filepath
must be specified, otherwise the data can't be loaded into memory. The filepath is set at in the second code
chunk. 

WARNING: the runtime of the entire notebook may take quite a while, since there are some complex algorithms
involved. 

Best regards,
Freek and Justin
